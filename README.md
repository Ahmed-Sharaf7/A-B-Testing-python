# A-B-Testing-python
This is an A/B test that an E-commerce company would use to decide wether to apply the new web page or not. The E-commerce company developed a new page in order to increase the number of users who 'convert' and pay for their product. The goal of the test is to help them decide if they should:
- Implement the new webpage,
- Keep the old webpage, or
- Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.


The project uses Python ( pandas, numpy, random and matplotlib)
